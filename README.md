# Charts App

The project is based on Angular 4.0 was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.

It shows stacked (bar) charts for data loaded from a delivered excel file which was saved as a .csv file. It is possible to filter the data by priority to see estimated number of days needed to finish in example only the most important tasks. Resolved/Unresolved button can be used to see the number of days needed to solve unresolved tasks or to see only finished task.

The demo of the project is available here: [http://patrykjankowski.pl/charts](http://patrykjankowski.pl/charts).
